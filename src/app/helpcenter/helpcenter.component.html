<h2 class="text-center">What Is an Investment Center?</h2>
An investment center is a business unit in a firm that can utilize capital to contribute directly to a company's profitability. You may compare and contrast some parallels like the terms "profit center" or "cost center."

Companies evaluate the performance of an investment center according to the revenues it brings in through investments in capital assets compared to the overall expenses.

An investment center is sometimes called an investment division.


An investment center is a business unit that a firm utilizes with its own capital to generate returns that benefit the firm.
The financing arm of an automobile maker or department store is a common example of an investment center.
Investment centers are increasingly important for firms as financialization leads companies to seek profits from investment and lending activities in addition to core production.

<h2 class="text-center">Understanding Investment Centers</h2>
The different departmental units within a company are categorized as either generating profits or running expenses. Organizational departments are classified into three different units: cost center, profit center, and investment center. A cost center focuses on minimizing costs and is assessed by how much expenses it incurs.

Examples of departments that make up the cost center are the human resource and marketing departments. A profit center is evaluated on the amount of profit that is generated and attempts to increase profits by increasing sales or reducing costs. Units that fall under a profit center include the manufacturing and sales department. In addition to departments, profit and cost centers can be divisions, projects, teams, subsidiary companies, production lines, or machines.

An investment center is a center that is responsible for its own revenues, expenses, and assets and manages its own financial statements which are typically a balance sheet and an income statement. Because costs, revenue, and assets have to be identified separately, an investment center would usually be a subsidiary company or a division.
